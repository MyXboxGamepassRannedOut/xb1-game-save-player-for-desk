theres many of ways to mod well if someone decrypt uw9 file exstentions mabey it could be easyer to just open the game save but theres only a few ways u can mod the game obviously u cant just place a code that when two buttons are pressed it opens a mod menu it is way more hectic since the actual game data is on the xbox servers and if u want to mod u need to make a dll mod menu and link it up to the exe also add way more files that makes it undectected and actually works also its common for xbox games to have weired a*s exe like gtav exe is called scarlet.exe or somthing like that but when u run the game just be prepared to see a f****n error since ur on desktop but u can mod and u can place it back into the xbox but need to make it a uw9 put it on a usb corupt it to xbox game manager and download it on normal mode or on dev u can just upload the file without changing it into a uw9 file and doing dat shit just network transfer if u want to convert and shit when ur not in dev use this https://digiex.net/threads/xbox-one-external-usb-storage-device-converter-xbox-one-formatted-usb-drives-on-pc.13583/ thats the best and prob the only actually working one and dont say i cant open the game files i just told u how dahhh
